This is my collection of Microsoft Teams iOS and Android silent screen captures, showing end users the most basic functions of Microsoft Teams.

I have created 9 videos detailing the following actions.
-Installing Microsoft Teams
-Logging into Microsoft Teams
-Chat with a Colleague
-Create a new Team
-Make a Video/Voice Call
-Set your Status Message
-Notification Settings for Teams
-Enabling Dark Mode
-Create a Multi-user chat, add a user and change the Chat Name

These videos where created on the 25th of March 2020 on iOS 13.4 and Android 10 and the features, steps and capabilities are subject to change.

To be clear, whilst I am a Microsoft employee, these are not official Microsoft published training materials. They are a screen capture representation of the product at a point in time and I will do my best to update them if major changes or additions. If you find any errors, please let me know and ill endeavour to update the videos.

Please contact me on LinkedIn if you would like to discuss, provide feedback, or request changes / updates.

All feedback is greatly appreciated!

Thank you,

Carlo A.
